# machineLearning

machine learning in python tutorial-ish; this is just me trying to understand
things better by explaining them. If it helps you out, that's cool.

There's lots of stuff to un-comment and try out; I encourage you to experiment
and see how it works out if you're having trouble with machine learning.
